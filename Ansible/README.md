# Ansible Playbook for Deploying Services

This playbook deploys the services defined in the  directory using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Must be installed on the target machine. You can download and install them from [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/). Follow the official installation instructions for your operating system.
- **Ansible:** Must be installed on the control machine (the machine you're running the playbook from).

## Installing Ansible

Before you can run the playbook, you need to install Ansible on the control machine.

### On Debian/Ubuntu:


### On CentOS/RHEL:


### Verify Installation:


## Usage
1. **Navigate to the Ansible directory:**
   

2. **Create  files for each service:**
   For each service in the  directory (e.g., , , etc.), you need to create a corresponding  file.  Here's how:

   *   **Create a new file:**  For example, to create the  file for , you would create a file named  (or similar) in the  directory.
   *   **Edit the file:** Open the file in a text editor and add the following content as a starting point:

       

   *   **Customize the file:**
       *   **:** Replace  with the actual Docker image name for the service.  This is the image that Docker will use to create the container.
       *   **:** Replace  with the appropriate port mapping.  The format is .  This maps a port on your host machine to a port inside the container.
       *   **Other Configuration:** Add any other necessary configuration options, such as environment variables (), volumes (), or dependencies ().  Refer to the Docker Compose documentation for more information: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

   *   **Repeat for each service:**  Repeat this process for each service in the  directory.

3. **Run the playbook:**
   

## Example  (for service1):



**Important Notes:**

*   **Docker Images:** You need to have the Docker images for each service available on the target machine. You can pull them from Docker Hub or build them yourself.
*   **Configuration:** The specific configuration options for each service will vary depending on the service itself. Refer to the service's documentation for more information.
*   **Error Handling:** If you encounter any errors during the playbook execution, check the Ansible output for details.
*   **Networking:**  Consider using Docker networks to isolate your services and improve security.
